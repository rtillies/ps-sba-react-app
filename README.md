* **Name**: Richard Tillies
* **Date**: April 15, 2024
* **Requirements**: 
[SBA React Web Application Project](https://ps-react-curriculum.herokuapp.com/320/project/)

## Objectives

1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
1. Hosted on Render.
1. Frequent commits to GitHub.
1. A README.md file in your GitHub repository

## Render and GitHub
* Render: [ps-sba-react-app.onrender.com](https://ps-sba-react-app.onrender.com/)
* GitHub: [rtillies/ps-sba-react-app](https://github.com/rtillies/ps-sba-react-app)

## Instructions

* A standard deck of cards has 52 cards (13 each of 4 suits) and 2 jokers.
* The first section of buttons filter by suit (spades, diamonds, clubs, hearts, joker). Click a button and only cards of that suit will remain.
* The next section of buttons filter by rank or value (ace, king, queen, jack, 10, ..., 3, 2). Click a button and only cards of that rank will remain.
* The ALL button will show all 54 cards.
* The SHUFFLE button will mix the cards and show all 54 cards.

## Notes

* The card objects (including images) are from the [Deck of cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/).
* Originally I had a navigation bar with multiple pages (all cards, filter by suit, filter by rank/value). Ultimately I realized the functionality I was trying to accomplish was best on a single page.
